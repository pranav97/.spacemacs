* .spacemacs

This repo just has one file, the dot spacemacs file. There are 2 branches. One for simple emacs install mostly meant for remote usage of spacemacs. 


** base emacs version 

 The emacs version shouldn't matter but there's a lot of configuration in user config that is specific to this version, when using this spacemacs file do not touch.

** Layers

 layers are the basic unit of instalation for a lot of spacemacs features. This feature set is limited because emacs is meant to be used remotely at least partially.
